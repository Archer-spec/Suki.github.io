    <h1>Family</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>My family is living an average life. There are four members in my family: my mom, dad, younger brother, and me. I'm pretty close with my family.</p>
        <p>First is about my mom. She's a strong, independent, strict, and fierce woman. She's the kind of person who's always on time and doesn't like to wait or make people wait, and she likes to plan everything first.</p>
        <p>Next is about my dad. He's a chill and independent guy. He's quite fierce and strict too. He's very organized with everything and laid back. He doesn't like to rush things and takes things slow.</p>
        <p>Lastly is about my younger brother. He's the youngest in my family. The age gap between me and him is 8 years. He likes to cause trouble and always teases me to make me angry. He's a funny, kind, and mischievous boy.</p>
