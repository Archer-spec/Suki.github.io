    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>I have experience working from my internship and at a cafe during my semester break. As for my studies, I'm majoring in Information Management at UiTM Segamat.</p>
        <p>For my internship experience, I applied at Hospital Segamat. I was placed in the department of quality management, record center, and library. I learned about how they retrieve and organize records. I also had to receive and send important documents or letters.</p>
        <p>My working experience during my semester break was at a cafe. They taught me how to greet and treat customers and provide customer service. I learned how to make a variety of drinks, prepare food, and had to memorize the food and drink SOPs. I personally enjoyed making drinks, especially coffee, for customers because it's really fun to use the machine.</p>
